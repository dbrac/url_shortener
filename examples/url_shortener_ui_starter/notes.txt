Search form
Domain (only support one initially which will be something similiar to s.f)
long url
short key
tags
owner
created before
created after
paging (won't need initially)
Search button

display results below the table and leave the search form visible to make subsquent searches easy.

I'll also need to build a "details" view where we display the detials of a shortener entry and allow for changes to be made
look at the s.f web page for example

model will look similiar to this:
key (short name)
long url
tags
owner
created date
hits
last hit date
delete date (auto delete after keep for x days expires)

backend
basically just a crud for this model with some good query strings
